• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
Git uses a gitignore file to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.
It should include file extensions for files you do not want to put in source control.


• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
When we merge a branch that is ahead of your checked-out branch(master) Git does a fast-forward while merging.

 • Why should you have different branches?
There are many reasons for why we should have different branches they are :
1)  If there are tow or more people working on the same project and want to work independently without effecting each other’s work.
2) The Master should always be a running branch un-affected by any future developments.
3) If in worst case the branch code breaks apart then we will always have a master code running which we can full and start again.

 • In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
In a project we usually have only one remote Git repository.
